seeped in racist thought
nor to fight for women’s rights
to become a corporate bot
don’t just shatter the glass ceiling
ignoring the sticky floor
if you came to save us
you can take the exit door
if you really believe in sisterhood
join us in our fight
no, we are not voiceless
just pass the goddam mic</description></item><item><title>the sprawl</title><link>/lunaranjit/post/the-sprawl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 06:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lunaranjit/post/the-sprawl/</guid><description>Looking down from the perch in Swayambhu
where tourists jostle with the locals for the view,
you see a multi-headed hydra
sprinting towards layers of
emerald hills guarding Kathmandu valley and the jagged
diamond peaks beyond, gobbling up
gold green fields along the way, guzzling
aquamarine ponds and lakes, spitting out
silver slivers of asphalt that crisscross
rivers’ and rivulets’ natural paths across the valley floor, belching
thick plumes of fumes that hang over the houses</description></item><item><title>they come in pairs</title><link>/lunaranjit/post/they-come-in-pairs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/lunaranjit/post/they-come-in-pairs/</guid><description>statistics says
on average
two coffins
come back to Nepal
every day
statistics does not say
those wooden boxes
also carry
shattered dreams
lost loves
forfeited futures
vanished hopes
statistics does not care
if anyone will remember
the young men who fly away
filled with aspiration and trepidation
who come back as numbers
in pairs
every single day</description></item></channel></rss>
