on average
two coffins
come back to Nepal
every day
statistics does not say
those wooden boxes
also carry
shattered dreams
lost loves
forfeited futures
vanished hopes
statistics does not care
if anyone will remember
the young men who fly away
filled with aspiration and trepidation
who come back as numbers
in pairs
every single day</description></item></channel></rss>
