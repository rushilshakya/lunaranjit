+++
Earlier this year, I was writing a lot, publishing sometimes, and had even applied for a fellowship. I was translating  a book of poetry. I was developing a writing workshop. I had finally felt ready to fully accept my "writer" persona and let go of my "organizer" past. Friends and family members were getting vaccinated, and the pandemic seemed to be getting under control. I was planning to launch this new website to share my updates. Well, as they say about best-laid plans...

We started seeing havoc unfold across the southern border in India, and braced ourselves for the worst. Nepal started following a few weeks behind - and soon enough we started seeing the same requests for hospital beds, oxygen, plasma, and updates about family members infected and dead. 

I joined an informal group pooling resources and coordinating to do what we can to mitigate the disaster. I shelved my plans and persona to excavate my past - I have spent the last few days digging through my old contact lists to find contacts and ideas to help us amplify the message and nudge US government to share vaccines with Nepal. 

So, I decided to use this space to share pandemic updates, observations & rants.  I will write more soon. In the meantime, please [**sign the petition to help us get vaccines to Nepal**](https://www.change.org/p/ambassador-randy-berry-get-covid-vaccines-to-nepal-asap-and-prevent-a-humanitarian-disaster). Please share it widely, with the tag #Vaccines4Nepal.
