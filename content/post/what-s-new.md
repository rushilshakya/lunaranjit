**April 14, 2021**

As we went into pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020, I decided to spend more time reading and writing. I read a lot and wrote a little. With support from friends, I started submitting my work and got published in a bunch of places. Most of the pieces I wrote, I published on Medium.

I have chosen to not hide any of my writing behind a paywall to make sure anyone interested can access them. If you've enjoyed my writings and would like to support, please consider buying me [**a cup of virtual chyaa**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lunaranjit). I think of it as online busking, except with writing instead of singing (and believe me, you don't want to hear me sing).

I have also been sharing my writings and random observations on a listserv. I have not been as regular as I would like. If you'd like to receive sporadic news and updates, please [**share your email**](http://tinyletter.com/LunaRanjit).
