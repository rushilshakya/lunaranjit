**April 14, 2021**

As we went into pandemic-induced lockdown in 2020, I decided to spend more time reading and writing. I read a lot and wrote a little. With support from friends, I started submitting my work and got published in a bunch of places. Most of the pieces I wrote, I published on [**Medium**](https://lunaranjit.medium.com/), many of which I have also re-posted on this website. I have written across issues and genres, from a very personal essay about choosing to remain childfree to a poem about collateral damage from US drone attacks.

I have chosen to not hide any of my writing behind a paywall so that anyone interested can access them. Whenever I am not feeling too self-conscious, I share them on social media. If you've enjoyed my writings and are able to support, please consider buying me a [**cup of virtual chyaa**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lunaranjit). I think of it as online busking, except with writing instead of singing (and believe me, you don't want to hear me sing).

I have also been sharing my writings and random observations on a listserv. I have not been as regular as I would like. If you'd like to receive sporadic news and updates and not already on the list, please [**share your email**](http://tinyletter.com/LunaRanjit).
