May Day greetings from the locked-down Kathmandu! We are in the early stages of a second wave. While the scale of India drowns out the news from Nepal, we too are heading towards a catastrophe. 

As we went into lockdown last year, I had decided to spend more time reading and writing to keep myself away from droomscolling all day. I read a lot, wrote a little, and got published a bunch of times. I have written across issues and genres, from a very personal essay about choosing to remain childfree to a poem about collateral damage from US drone attacks. Most of the pieces I wrote, I published on [**Medium**](https://lunaranjit.medium.com/) (if you have a Medium account, please leave some claps or comments). I have re-posted some of my favorites on this website, and plan to continue sharing new work here.

Whenever I am not feeling too self-conscious, I have shared my writing on social media as well. I have decided to not keep my writing behind a paywall and make it accessible to everyone interested in accessing them. If you've enjoyed my writings and are able to support, please consider buying me a [**cup of virtual chyaa**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lunaranjit). I think of it as online busking, except with writing instead of singing (and believe me, you don't want to hear me sing).

I have also been sharing my writings and random observations on a listserv. I have not been as regular as I would like. If you'd like to receive sporadic news and updates and not already on the list, please [**share your email**](http://tinyletter.com/LunaRanjit). 

I plan to share updates here. Please check back again. 

Stay safe, wherever you are.
