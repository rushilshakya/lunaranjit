statistics says  
on average  
two coffins  
come back to Nepal  
every day

statistics does not say  
those wooden boxes  
also carry  
shattered dreams  
lost loves  
forfeited futures  
vanished hopes

statistics does not care  
if anyone will remember  
the young men who fly away  
filled with aspiration and trepidation  
who come back as numbers  
in pairs  
every single day
