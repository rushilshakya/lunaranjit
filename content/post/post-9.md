Looking down from the perch in Swayambhu  
where tourists jostle with the locals for the view,  
you see a multi-headed hydra  
sprinting towards layers of  
emerald hills guarding Kathmandu valley and the jagged  
diamond peaks beyond, gobbling up  
gold green fields along the way, guzzling  
aquamarine ponds and lakes, spitting out  
silver slivers of asphalt that crisscross  
rivers’ and rivulets’ natural paths across the valley floor, belching  
thick plumes of fumes that hang over the houses  
that look like pieces of legos placed haphazardly  
by an impatient child.
