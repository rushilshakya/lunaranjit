**a short food memoir**

When I first started writing about home, I fell straight into the tired South Asian American trope and wrote about nostalgia for mango juice running down my arms in the summer. I do love mangoes, but nostalgia for them was a stretch. But that’s what I had been reading from people who looked the most like me, and that’s what came out. I was trying to repackage someone else’s memory as my own.

I grew up in temperate Kathmandu valley. Our mangoes came in trucks from the flatlands in southern Nepal and further south in India, and were sold off the baskets on bicycles by street vendors. I had never picked a mango from the tree. I had not even seen a mango tree. Mangoes were an expensive treat. During the short season, we carefully cut one mango after dinner and shared among the three of us, savoring every last bit. We couldn’t afford to waste mango juice by letting it run down my arms. But you know, single story and whatnot.

Summer is not a haloed memory for me the way it is for my compatriots who grew up further south. Summer break was a short one in the middle of the school year. With incessant rain, I mostly stayed indoors and tried to finish school assignments. Winter break, on the other hand, was glorious. Meen pachas ko bida — those fifty days when temperature dropped so much, even fish supposedly felt cold. Exams were over. I could sit in the sun and read all day if I wanted. And of course, the taste of winter foods.

Lapsi is in season, showing up in our daily meals as achar and as the forbidden titaura to be consumed away from the eyes of the adults. Bhogate, saved from Kija Puja ceremony two months earlier, dipped in salt and chili powder, or when we felt more ambitious, mixed with other smaller citrus fruits, yoghurt, and spices. Even the thought of these sweet and sour treats still makes me salivate. And of course, all the winter greens piled high on the dokos and kharpans of the farmers in the early mornings — the sharp taste of tori, the earthy taste of bethu, the pungent taste of lasun.

It has taken me years of writing to feel comfortable enough to start excavating my own memories and have confidence in my own stories.

As I claim my space to add my memories and my community’s stories, I also wonder whose voices are still missing. The single story of Nepal with one language and one culture, promoted during the Panchayat era, has meant that daal-bhat became our staple food and momos became the ubiquitous nostalgia-inducing snack. Gone were the stories of yomari, haku chhoyela, rikikur, yangben faksa, batuk chukauni, and phalgi. Along with the stories, the food items themselves started disappearing, taking along them our sense of community, our sense of belonging.

Recently in Nepal, people have started reclaiming their identity, reviving their languages and clothes. Alongside, there is also a small but growing movement to re-introduce forgotten food items. Chhoyela and yomari were always a part of my life thanks to the culinary skills my aji passed on to my mother and my aunts. I am only now breaking out of my Kathmandu-centric lens and learning about kinema and yangben, latte and ghonghi, lambar and noshin tey, and slowly building my knowledge of indigenous food items from across Nepal.

I am learning about the history and politics of food in Nepal, and also creating new food memories that I can wax nostalgic about later.
