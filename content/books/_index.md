**Alien**

Alien is an immigrant narrative, told in poetry and prose, about the fragile balance between building a new life in an adopted land and memories of homes left behind - stories encapsulating joy, pain, hope and insecurity of uprooted/displaced lives. Alien is the legal term for someone who is “not a citizen or national of the United States,” and it was also my precarious immigration status for almost twenty years.
